# SnowCast: Lake-Effect Snow Prediction with Hybrid Multimodal CNN-LSTM Network May 2023
- Developed a hybrid model combining 3D-CNN and LSTM networks to predict snow with 97.7% accuracy
- Designed a multimodal architecture processing both - radar images and numerical meteorological data for snow prediction
- Created a novel data preparation function to transform the numerical data into sliding window of observations to predict
snow 3 days in advance based on 5 days of historical data
- Boosted the overall accuracy of Lake-effect snow prediction by 43%, surpassing the baseline decision tree model
